The research that I have been doing with Dr. Navarro Perez has been in developing computational models for nuclear scattering data in order to make predictions. This has been done by utilizing machine learning techniques to train a random forest to read an existing database of experimental data and use that data to determine the relative importances and relation between the variables. We can then use that model to make predictions with high accuracy at any value of lab frame energy and scattering angle for a particular reaction type and observable.

Particularly, we have been focusing on neutron-proton interactions with the SGT and SGTT observables due to the scattering angle for these reactions being 0, allowing that variable to be ignored, and that these two observables can be used for calculations that yield further insight into the complex subtleties of the interactions between the variables in scattering experiments.
