#### Hypothesis
I am working from the hypothesis that we can create a computational model to predict nuclear scattering data. It is important to do this as, with sufficient accuracy, models such as this can eliminate the need to measure new data experimentally which can potentially be a financial burden on the institution conducting the experiment.

This scattering data can shed light onto the complexities of particle reactions that, at this point point, are not known to the scientific community with absolute certainty.

#### Statement of Methods
This particular model has been generated by utilizing machine learning techniques to train a random forest to read an existing database of experimental data and use that data to determine the relative importances and relation between the variables of the experiments.

This random forest acts as a decision tree of potentially infinite bounds that asks a series of yes or no questions regarding the values of the input in order to eventually get to the correct output. Like any machine learning model, this is done by training the tree with a known set of inputs and outputs so that the tree can "learn" the correct questions to ask and in what order so that when it is tested using data that was not included in the training, it can produce results extremely close to the true experimental value in order to determine its general validity. This accuracy of the prediction relative to the true value is generally referred to as the tree's "score, "of which mine generally would be in the range of 87%-99%, with the variation coming from the tree randomly deciding which data would be used for training and which for testing making it slightly different each time it is compiled. 

We can then use that model to make predictions with high accuracy at any value of laboratory frame energy and scattering angle for a particular reaction type and observable.

#### Essential Results and Outcomes
The goal of this research is to create a model that can be used to create a computational model for that scattering data on nucleons. This model can then be compared with existing models to determine its validity and how useful its results are.

For a number of reasons, I have been focusing primarily on two particular observable, neutron-proton SGT and neutron-proton SGTT. This is primarily because the scattering angle for both of them is set to a constant 0, meaning that at the very least it can be used as a proof of concept as it makes accurate predictions when the only iput is the laboratory frame energy.

EXPAND ON HOW THIS MODEL IS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC OBSERVABLES
#### Conclusion
EXPAND ON HOW THIS MODEL WORKS WELL IN REGIONS WHERE THERE IS EXISTING DATA BUT FAILS WHERE THERE IS NOT DATA FOR IT TO WORK WITH. MIGHT NEED TO UTILIZE OTHER COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO FILL IN GAPS.
