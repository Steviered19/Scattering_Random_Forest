#### Hypothesis
I am working from the hypothesis that we can create a computational model with machine learning to predict nuclear scattering data.

Scattering data can be used to shed light onto the properties of interactions between nucleons that, at this point point, are not known to the scientific community with absolute certainty. There are currently many gaps in experimental scattering data and it is these gaps that I am striving to fill with a predictive model. This model can then be used to eliminate the need to measure new data experimentally which can be a financial burden on those conducting the experiment.

#### Statement of Methods
This particular model has been generated by creating a random forest using existing experimental data to determine the relation between the experimental variables.

A random forest is a decision tree that asks a series of binary questions regarding the input to make the correct prediction. This is done by training the tree with a known set of inputs and outputs so that the tree can "learn" the correct questions to ask. After testing with other known data to ensure functionality, we can use that model to make predictions at any value of laboratory frame energy and scattering angle for a particular measurement.

#### Essential Results and Outcomes
The goal of this research is to create a predictive model for nuclear scattering data. Preliminary results have had an accuracy between 87-99%, with variation coming from the random decision on what data is used in training which creates a slightly different tree each time.  

I plan to compare my model with other existing models to determine its validity. The advantage of my model is that it creates pseudo-experimental data that is not based on the physical assumptions other models must make.

#### Conclusion
At this point in my research, I have been focusing on neutron-proton SGT and SGTT data to act as a proof of concept as they have a constant scattering angle. However, it currently fails in regions where there is little existing data for it to train with. Going forward I might need to fill in those gaps with other computationally generated data from other models.
