#### Hypothesis
I am working from the hypothesis that we can create a computational model with machine learning to predict nuclear scattering data.

Scattering data can be used to shed light onto the properties of interactions between neutrons and protons that, at this point point, are not known to the scientific community with absolute certainty.

There are currently many gaps in the collection of experimental scattering data and it is these very gaps that I am striving to fill with a predictive model. This model can then be used to eliminate the need to measure new data experimentally which can potentially be a financial burden on the institution conducting the experiment.

#### Statement of Methods
This particular model has been generated by training a random forest on existing experimental data and using that data to determine the relative importances and relation between the variables of the experiments.

This random forest acts as a decision tree that asks a series of yes or no questions regarding the values of the input in order to eventually get to the correct output prediction. This is done by training the tree with a known set of inputs and outputs so that the tree can "learn" the correct questions to ask. It is then tested using other data to produce results extremely close to the true experimental value in order to determine its general validity.

We can then use that model to make predictions at any value of laboratory frame energy and scattering angle for a particular reaction type and observable.

#### Essential Results and Outcomes
The goal of this research is to create a predictive computational model for scattering data of nucleons. This accuracy of the prediction relative to the true value is generally referred to as the tree's "score, " of which the preliminary results of mine are generally in the range of 87%-99%. The variation comes from the tree randomly deciding which data would be used for training and which for testing making it slightly different each time it is generated.

Ultimately, my goal is to compare my model with other existing, commonly used models to determine its validity and how useful its results are. The advantage of my model is that it creates pseudo-experimental data as it is not based on any of the physical assumptions other models must utilize.

#### Conclusion
At this point in my research, I have been primarily focusing on neutron-proton SGT and SGTT data to act as a proof of concept as they have a constant scattering angle, meaning that that variable can be neglected. However, this model currently fails in regions where there is little existing experimental data for it to train with. Going forward I might need to fill in those gaps with other computationally generated data from other models.
