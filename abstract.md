#### Hypothesis
I am working from the hypothesis that we can create a computational model to predict nuclear scattering data. It is important to do this as, with sufficient accuracy, models such as this can eliminate the need to measure new data experimentally which can potentially be a financial burden on the institution conducting the experiment.
#### Statement of Methods
This has been done by utilizing machine learning techniques to train a random forest to read an existing database of experimental data and use that data to determine the relative importances and relation between the variables. We can then use that model to make predictions with high accuracy at any value of lab frame energy and scattering angle for a particular reaction type and observable.
